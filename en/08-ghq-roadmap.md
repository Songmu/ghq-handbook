# The future of ghq

Finally, I would like to conclude this document by writing about the future of GHQ.

## Future feature additions

Requests for additional features are accepted on GitHub Issues. Pull requests are of course also welcome.

We have also released v1, and I think the functionality has reached its final stage. I want it to be a simple tool, so I'm not too proactive about adding features. That said, I'm thinking of the following, although it's at a delusional level.

- `ghq list <query>` strengthening
- Improvement of difficult-to-understand query specifications
- Specifying regular expressions, other narrowing options, etc.
- `ghq list` --jsonJSON output by etc.
- `ghq list` - further speedup\n
- Regular caching by background server, etc.

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to the original author, motemen, for bringing such a wonderful tool to the world. I also learned a lot about Go by taking over the maintenance of this tool.

Thanks to Go. The original idea came from `go get`, and `ghq` was written in Go, so without Go, `ghq` wouldn't be what it is today. Thank you very much to everyone on the Go team.

Thank you for the many pull requests. As of January 4, 2020, a whopping 46 people have contributed to the codebase. We would also like to thank those who raised issues.

Thank you for the many GitHub stars. As of January 4, 2020, we have received 1,572 stars. I feel fortunate to be able to be involved in this kind of OSS maintenance.

Thank you for the many introductory articles. We were introduced in various places such as blogs and Twitter, and `ghq` was able to acquire many users.

Thank you for your sponsorship. The original author motemen and I, the main maintainer, have opened GitHub Sponsor, and several people have already sponsored us.

Thank you to my family. This document was written on a whim during the year-end and New Year holidays of 2019-2020. Also, since I do my regular OSS activities in my spare time, I cannot do these activities without the understanding of my family. Thank you so much.

## About contribution

Things like what was written in the acknowledgment section in the previous section actually lead to contributions. Even just starring us on GitHub or tweeting us on Twitter is a big contribution.
